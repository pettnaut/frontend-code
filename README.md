## Contributing

Before start contributing read our [Contributing guide](https://github.com/pettnaut/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) . 
> Please be aware that if you start work on an issue without receiving a reply first, your efforts might be wasted if it is decided that the issue is no longer suitable for a fix.

We have our components in `src/components` and also we have a mockup for each component at `src/stories/` using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction/). 
If you create  new component you also have to create a mockup file at `src/stories` with the sintaxis `Component.stories.js`

### How to see the mockups using Storybook?
It is really easy. Just run:
```
npm run storybook 
```
Then checkout <http://localhost:6006/>
